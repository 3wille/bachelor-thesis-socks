# IPv6 Address hopping - SOCKS5 proxy

This repository is part of my thesis "Design and Implementation of Context-aware IPv6 Address Hopping".
To a browser, the proxy behaves similar to the one delivered with Tor and The Tor Browser.

## Initialize Subrepository

The larger part of this prototype is implemented in a fork of github.com/oov/socks5.
It is tweaked to support above functionality. To Initialize the subrepo run ``git submodule update --init`` or clone the whole repo with ``git clone --recursive <url>``.

## Build

To trigger a build of the go package run ``make build``.
This yields an executable ``main``.

## Usage

On execution the ``config.yml`` is loaded and parsed.
It may contain several prefixes.
Each time a new address is generated by the proxy, a random prefix is picked from the list and a random suffix generated for it.

## Setup
The host on which the proxy shall run needs to be set up.
First, it needs to be reachable by the prefix configured in ``config.yml``.
I use a prefix from Hurricane Electric's Tunnelbroker.
My tunnel setup can be seen in the bash script ``setup_tunnel``.

Then, the prefix has to configured to use AnyIP in the linux system.
The bash script ``setup_anyip`` configures two example prefixes.
